
Ideas flow:

1. All javascript generation (problem with questions, we need a database)
2. Get the full question including HTML from the server (full control from the server, bad separation of concerns)
3. Get only a set of key fields from the server (json parsing, strict templating, bigger client, less traffic)

Going with option 2 for now
